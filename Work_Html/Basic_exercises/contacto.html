    <h1>Whi the programming?</h1>
    <p>I chose programming because I want to create a website, a server, an application, and a project to help people and make things easier for them. 
        I also want to experience the satisfaction of seeing how a website is helping so many people find what they're looking for, whether at university or any other location related to what they want to learn or study. 
        I'm also very impressed by the backend; the database is everything they're looking for (hacking). I'm also very interested in how it's possible to hack servers or databases in many ways.
